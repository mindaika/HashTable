MARIS_001
Hey there, welcome to my little shop.  I have a ton of things for sale.  I'm also willing to buy any extra gear you might be tired of carrying.
MARIS_002
I absolutely guarantee that I have the best prices you will find.
MARIS_003
I don't care what that other shopkeeper says about my stuff.  I know it's the best.
MARIS_004
Would you like to see what I have for sale or would you like to sell me something?
MARIS_005
Here you go.
MARIS_006
I'm afraid that's my best offer.
MARIS_007
How does %s gold coins sound?
MARIS_008
To be honest, I don't know where I got that thing from.
MARIS_009
This piece of junk? I wouldn't pay a single coin for that!
MARIS_010
I'm afraid I don't have anything left in my story for sale.
MARIS_011
I've got to close shop now.  Please come back tomorrow.
MARIS_012
Thanks! I'll take it.
MARIS_013
I have more than one of those available.  How many do you want?
MARIS_014
Thank you so much for your business.  Please come back soon.
MARIS_015
I've had this shop for close to 15 years.  I just love this little town.
MARIS_016
I'm afraid I just stick to myself.  I'm not much of a gossip.
MARIS_017
I don't have any work to offer.  But you might check with the miller up the road.
MILLER_001
What do you want?
MILLER_002
I'm busy so get to your point.
MILLER_003
Yeah, I have some work for you.  Here's what I've got.
MILLER_004
Take these bags of flour to the store.
MILLER_005
Repair the waterwheel on my mill.
MILLER_006
Thresh this wheat for a while.
MILLER_007
Collect on a debt from that stingy farmer in the valley.
MILLER_008
I could tell from your look that you weren't really up for work.
MILLER_009
I'll decide how much to pay when I see how much you do.
MILLER_010
I've been around these parts for all my life.
MILLER_011
I don't know nothing about trouble.  I just mind to my own business.
MILLER_012
Is that the best you can do?  My brother's sick goat works faster than that.
MILLER_013
I'm not sure that I'm going to pay you anything for work like that.
MILLER_014
I can't even tell if you started working or not.
MILLER_015
Here, I'll pay you %s gold for that bit that you did.
MILLER_016
Well, if you can't find anything else to do I can put you to work again.
MISC_001
I don't understand you
MISC_002
What?
MISC_003
What language is that?
MISC_004
No idea what you just said.
MISC_005
I'm only ignoring you cause I don't know what you said.
MISC_006
What is that?
MISC_007
Where are you going?
MISC_008
What is your name?
MISC_009
I don't have one.
MISC_010
Ouch! Don't do that again!
GENIE_001
Hello! I'm a magic genie!  I can grant you three wishes!
GENIE_002
What is your first wish?
GENIE_003
What is your second wish?
GENIE_004
What is your third and final wish?
GENIE_005
No, I can't do that.
GENIE_006
That is beyond my abilities.
GENIE_007
You wish has been granted.
